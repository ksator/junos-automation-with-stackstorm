How to automate Junos with stackstorm. 

## about stackstorm
StackStorm is event-driven automation: 
- it doesnt rely on human input. 
- it reacts to events.  

Stackstorm has network automation capabilities with the stackstorm packs napalm and ansible. So stackstorm can fire napalm or ansible content based on events.
